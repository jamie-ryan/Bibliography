  absract = {Precipitation of electrons due to collisions necessarily occurs in trap models for hard X-ray bursts, and the thick-target emission from the precipitating electrons produces an X-ray spectrum similar in intensity and spectral shape to that from the trapped electrons. Such a trap-plus-precipitation model combines attractive features and removes some of the difficulties of thick-target and simple trap models. The evolution of the trap-plus-precipitation model is amenable to an analytical description, which is presented, including inversion, to find the injection electron spectrum from the X-ray spectrum. Streaming instabilities are unlikely to be important. Resonant scattering is also probably not important for the electrons which emit most of the X-rays, but may well be important for the higher-energy electrons which generate microwave bursts.},

  absract = {The time structure of hard X-ray emission during solar flares shows subsecond pulses, which have an energy-dependent timing that is consistent with electron time-of-flight delays. The inferred time-of-flight distances imply an injection height about 50 percent above the soft X-ray-bright flare loops, where electrons are injected in a synchronized way. No physical injection mechanism is known that can account for the energy synchronization and duration of subsecond pulses. Here we propose a model in terms of dynamic loss cone angle evolution of newly reconnected magnetic field lines that relax from the cusp at the reconnection point into a force-free configuration, which can explain the subsecond pulse structure of injected particles as well as the observed correlation between the pulse duration and flare loop size. This quantitative model predicts that the pulse duration of hard X-ray or radio pulses scales with tw~2LB/vA (s), which is the Alfv√©nic transit time through the magnetic outflow region of a Petschek-type X-point with magnetic length scale LB, and thus provides a direct diagnostic of the magnetic reconnection geometry. It also demonstrates that the observed pulse durations are primarily controlled by the injection time rather than by the acceleration timescale.},

  abstract={White-light emissions were observed from an X1.7 class solar flare on 2012 January 27, using three continuum bands (red, green, and blue) of the Solar Optical Telescope on board the Hinode satellite. This event occurred near the solar limb, and so differences in the locations of the various emissions are consistent with differences in heights above the photosphere of the various emission sources. Under this interpretation, our observations are consistent with the white-light emissions occurring at the lowest levels of where the Ca II H emission occurs. Moreover, the centers of the source regions of the red, green, and blue wavelengths of the white-light emissions are significantly displaced from each other, suggesting that those respective emissions are emanating from progressively lower heights in the solar atmosphere. The temperature distribution was also calculated from the white-light data, and we found the lower-layer emission to have a higher temperature. This indicates that high-energy particles penetrated down to near the photosphere, and deposited heat into the ambient lower layers of the atmosphere.}
